A Katacoda scenario is a series of Markdown files, bash scripts and a JSON file to define how your scenario should be configured, the text for the scenario and any automation required.

## Task
The first thing to do is to create an account, a username and connect the account to a github repository you have created by activating the webhook. A [webhook](https://sendgrid.com/blog/whats-webhook/) (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately. With the webhook feture in github, all your changes in your repository would be effected automatically. Read up on how to get this done here : https://www.katacoda.community/author-profile.html#github

#### Lets begin!

Clone our example repository that contains our scenario (in your case this repository would be empty) with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/MavenCode/KubeflowTraining.git`{{execute}}

The repository contains a sample course and a list of scenarios that I created for this experiment.

***Please take note this exercise can be done in your system's CLI.***
