## What is Kubeflow?

Kubeflow is the open source machine learning toolkit on top of Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is the industry standard for software delivery at scale and Kubeflow provides the cloud-native interface between K8s and data science tools - libraries, frameworks, pipelines, notebooks - bringing the Ops to ML.

## Kubeflow Training

This repo is part of the 5-day Kubeflow enterprise training provided by Canonical and Mavencode. 

Throughout this training, experts from Mavencode and Canonical will guide you through the steps from installing Kubeflow to building real-world machine learning pipelines using Kubeflow & Kale, serve your models, how ML operators and Tf jobs work and how to tune model parameters with Katib.
