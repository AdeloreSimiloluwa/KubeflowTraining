# KubeflowTraining


Kubeflow is the machine learning toolkit for Kubernetes. It is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning workflows on 
Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. The essence of Kubeflow is to provide a straightforward way to deploy open-source 
systems for ML to diverse infrastructures. .

Join epxerts from Mavencode and Canonical to learn how to Kubeflow is enabled on Microk8s, how to build real-world machine learning pipelines 
using Kubeflow & Kale, serve your models , how Ml operators and Tf jobs work and how to tune model parameters with katib.
